/**
  I want to create a more organic approch to authoring new gambits, topics and replies
  Right now, the system parses flat files to a intermediate JSON object that SS reads and
  creates an in-memory topic representation.

  I belive by introducing a Topic DB with a clean API we can have a faster more robust authoring
  expierence parseing input will become more intergrated into the topics, and Im propising
  changing the existing parse inerface with a import/export to make sharing SuperScript
  data (and advanced authoring?) easier.

  We also want to put more focus on the Gambit, and less on topics. A Gambit should be
  able to live in several topics.
