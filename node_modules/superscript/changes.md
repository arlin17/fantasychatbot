* Adds a new command `%%` for dynamic conversations (gh-206). 

This works by setting some state in a reply for example:
```
+ some input
- some reply {key=value}
```

Then later in the conversation you can create a condition by one of three methods:
```
// trigger is assumed to be a wildcard
%% (key === value) 
- now say this

// setting a trigger 
%% (key === value) 
+ then match this
- now say this

// Set a collection of gambits
%% (key === value) {
  + then match this
  - now say this

  + or that
  - now really say this
}
```
The conversation state is whiped clean when you the topic changes.
